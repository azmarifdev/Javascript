# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language primarily known for its role in web development. It is a:

- **Client-Side Scripting Language:** Runs in the user's web browser, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Object-Oriented Language:** Organizes code using objects for modularity and reusability.

- **Event-Driven Programming:** Allows developers to respond to user actions by defining event handlers.

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Supports asynchronous operations through callbacks and promises.

- **Cross-Browser Compatible:** Supported by major web browsers, ensuring code compatibility across platforms.

- **Libraries and Frameworks:** Has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, for streamlined development.

- **Server-Side Development:** With Node.js, JavaScript can be used for server-side development, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development, contributing to the creation of dynamic, interactive, and responsive websites and web applications.
